  abstract = {Trophic studies are fundamental components of our understanding of biology and ecology, from observing individual organisms to modelling ecosystem function. When measuring fish gut contents, we rely on collecting samples that represent snapshots in time. Many limitations in extrapolating from these snapshots are well understood. However, there seems to be a widespread belief that when quantifying the composition of gut contents, more detail always provides more information. We highlight some fundamental problems with the apparently more quantitative approaches (i.e. ‘bulk’ methods measuring biomass or volume of each prey type) and suggest that frequency of occurrence (\%F) provides the most robust and interpretable measure of diet composition. The additional information provided by bulk methods contains unquantifiable and potentially significant error from a variety of sources. In our experience, the contents of most guts cannot be unambiguously separated into prey categories for quantification because of the presence of unidentifiable and inseparable partially digested material. Even where separation is possible, the composition of a gut at one point in time is affected by many unquantifiable factors unrelated to the actual composition of the diet. Consequently, bulk methods provide ambiguous interpretations from superficially quantitative models. Where research questions require more detail, these problems mean there is little alternative to time-consuming approaches like prey reconstruction. However, for the descriptions of dietary composition presented in many studies, \%F provides robust data that overcome many of the limitations of the more detailed approaches and provides considerable logistical and economic benefits.},

  abstract = {This study presents an analysis of the bias introduced by using simplified methods to calculate food intake of fish from stomach contents. Three sources of bias were considered: (1) the effect of estimating consumption based on a limited number of stomach samples, (2) the effect of using average contents derived from pooled stomach samples rather than individual stomachs, and (3) the effect of ignoring biological factors that affect the evacuation of prey. Estimating consumption from only two stomach samples yielded results close to the actual intake rate in a simulation study. In contrast to this, a serious positive bias was introduced by estimating food intake from the contents of pooled stomach samples. An expression is given that can be used to correct analytically for this bias. A new method, which takes into account the distribution and evacuation of individual prey types as well as the effect of other food in the stomach on evacuation, is suggested for estimating the intake of separate prey types. Simplifying the estimation by ignoring these factors biased estimates of consumption of individual prey types by up to 150\% in a data example.},

Although applications of the technique have enhanced our understanding of mammalian biology, it remains underused. Here we provide a review of previous applications to the study of extant mammals, drawing when appropriate on examples from the wider ecological literature, to identify the potential for future development of the approach. 2 Stable isotope analysis has been applied successfully to understanding the basic foraging decisions of mammals. However, SIA generates quantitative data on a continuous scale meaning that the approach can be particularly powerful in the characterization of community metrics, such as dimensions of resource partitioning within species assemblages or nutrient dynamics in food chains. Resolving spatial and temporal patterns of individual, intraspecific and interspecific resource use is of fundamental importance in animal ecology and evolutionary biology and SIA will emerge as a critical tool in these fields. 3 Geographical differences in naturally occurring stable isotopes have allowed ecologists to describe large-scale mammal migrations. Several isotopic gradients exist at smaller spatial scales, which can provide finer resolution of spatial ecology. 4 A combination of foraging and movement decisions is of prime importance in the study of ecotoxicology, since this discipline requires quantitative understanding of exposure risk.},

  abstract = {1 A new top predator, the dragonfly Cordulegaster boltonii Donovan, ‘invaded’ a stream with a well-described food web. 2 The pre-invasion web was species-poor but complex, with prevalent intraguild predation, cannibalism and omnivory. Such characteristics differ from expectations based upon the early food web literature, but are consistent with more recent empirical webs and theoretical developments. 3 Exhaustive sampling was necessary to describe web structure, with the gut contents of several hundred individuals being required to reach the asymptote of the total number of links for individual species. There was no single ‘standard’ sample size that was applicable for estimating the number of links: sampling ‘x’ guts gave a different fraction of the asymptotic value for different species. Smaller predators were more prone to underestimation of links than larger species higher in the web. 4 The number of feeding links, trophic status and the degree of omnivory increased progressively with predator body size, both within and among species. The diet of each predator species (or instar) was effectively a subset of the diet of the next largest predator. 5 The invader was extremely polyphagous and fed at all trophic levels. Mean chain length increased by half a link following the invasion. Web complexity, and omnivory in particular, also increased. Pre- and post-invasion webs displayed intervality and rigid circuitry. The resident predators were frequently eaten by the invader, but the only significant predators of C. boltonii were larger conspecifics. Although no species have yet been deleted, there has been a 21\% increase in links for a 6\% increase in species since the invasion, suggesting that the members of the web had become more tightly packed within niche space. Most prey species were eaten by every predator species (including C. boltonii), indicating the potential for strong apparent competition within the web.},

Using a large, moderately well-known web, we simulated ecologists’ efforts to detect member species and links between them at a variety of sampling intensities, and then we analyzed the effects of sampling intensity on a large number of properties of the resulting webs. Four striking points emerged. First, the properties of this single web vary markedly with the intensity of sampling: incompleteness of data can strongly bias estimates of food-web properties. Second, the original values are reached only after a high level of sampling, much higher than is typical for many studies. Third, the properties of most webs in the ECOWeB database lie at the poorly sampled end of the ranges. Fourth, the detection of trophic links systematically lags behind the detection and inclusion of species, which may render the accurate measurement of many web properties inherently problematic. These results suggest that both the incompleteness of the existing data and our focus on properties that are sensitive to that incompleteness may be giving us a misleading picture of the trophic structure of ecological communities.},

A high-resolution taxonomic description has been produced to characterise the different community components. We have also determined the trophic relationships among organisms by analysing their gut contents. From the network topology, we extracted several descriptors of structural complexity of the comunity in terms of number of nodes and links. We found a positive relationship between connectance and diversity (both biological and functional). Moreover, we developed and applied a quantitative approach to estimate the link strength, which showed that not all links constituting the network are equally important. In the present paper, we show that the strength of the food-web links vary over time, but there is a natural tendency to keep a small set of strong links throughout the year. However, the existence of two consecutive strong links is not common, meaning that trophic cascades are not promoted.},

  abstract = {Stable isotope ratios (typically of carbon and nitrogen) provide one representation of an organism's trophic niche and are widely used to examine aspects of food web structure. Yet stable isotopes have not been applied to quantitatively characterize community-wide aspects of trophic structure (i.e., at the level of an entire food web). We propose quantitative metrics that can be used to this end, drawing on similar approaches from ecomorphology research. For example, the convex hull area occupied by species in δ13C–δ15N niche space is a representation of the total extent of trophic diversity within a food web, whereas mean nearest neighbor distance among all species pairs is a measure of species packing within trophic niche space. To facilitate discussion of opportunities and limitations of the metrics, we provide empirical and conceptual examples drawn from Bahamian tidal creek food webs. These examples illustrate how this methodology can be used to quantify trophic diversity and trophic redundancy in food webs, as well as to link individual species to characteristics of the food web in which they are embedded. Building from extensive applications of stable isotope ratios by ecologists, the community-wide metrics may provide a new perspective on food web structure, function, and dynamics.},

For asking questions on how food webs are built and work, we need descriptions of food webs at different levels of resolution. DNA techniques provide opportunities for highly resolved webs. In this paper, we offer an exposé of how DNA-based techniques, and DNA barcodes in particular, have recently been used to construct food web structure in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. We highlight how such techniques can be applied to simultaneously improve the taxonomic resolution of the nodes of the web (i.e., the species), and the links between them (i.e., who eats whom). We end by proposing how DNA barcodes and DNA information may allow new approaches to the construction of larger interaction webs, and overcome some hurdles to achieving adequate sample size. Most importantly, we propose that the joint adoption and development of these techniques may serve to unite approaches to food web studies in aquatic and terrestrial systems—revealing the extent to which food webs in these environments are structured similarly to or differently from each other, and how they are linked by dispersal.},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

While no single network theory index provides an appropriate guide to management for all food webs, a modified version of the Google PageRank algorithm reliably minimizes the chance and severity of negative outcomes. Our analysis shows that by prioritizing ecosystem management based on the network-wide impact of species protection rather than species loss, we can substantially improve conservation outcomes.},

  abstract = {Different species are of different importance in maintaining ecosystem functions in natural communities. Quantitative approaches are needed to identify unusually important or influential, ‘keystone’ species particularly for conservation purposes. Since the importance of some species may largely be the consequence of their rich interaction structure, one possible quantitative approach to identify the most influential species is to study their position in the network of interspecific interactions. In this paper, I discuss the role of network analysis (and centrality indices in particular) in this process and present a new and simple approach to characterizing the interaction structures of each species in a complex network. Understanding the linkage between structure and dynamics is a condition to test the results of topological studies, I briefly overview our current knowledge on this issue. The study of key nodes in networks has become an increasingly general interest in several disciplines: I will discuss some parallels. Finally, I will argue that conservation biology needs to devote more attention to identify and conserve keystone species and relatively less attention to rarity.},

  abstract = {Seasonal food webs were constructed for the whole invertebrate assemblage (meio- and macrofauna) inhabiting Broadstone Stream (southeast England). High and uniform taxonomic resolution was applied in a dietary analysis, by resolving the complete benthic community to species, including the meiofauna, protozoa, and algae. Meiofauna accounted for 70\% of all species in the summary web and for 73\% and 63\% of those in the summer/autumn and spring webs, respectively. The web structure changed between summer/autumn and winter/spring, due to differences in species composition. Many stream invertebrates fed on meiofauna and organic matter. Addition of meiofauna to the Broadstone web increased the percentage of intermediate species. Seasonal webs contained between 54 (spring 1997) and 86 (autumn 1996) interactive taxa and 229–378 trophic links. Marked differences in web complexity were found between the summer/autumn and winter/spring periods. Meiofauna accounted for most of the links in the web with a high proportion of intermediate–intermediate links in summer and autumn (0.421–0.440) and also of intermediate–basal links during winter and spring (0.509–0.628). In general, the summary web showed that intermediate species and basal resources were numerically dominant components in this stream. Web connectance rose slightly between summer (0.052) and winter (0.061) and increased further in spring (0.079), coinciding with a reduction in species number. A high fraction of detritivores was combined with omnivorous predators, many of which supplemented their diets with organic matter and, depending on season, with algae and invertebrate eggs. In addition, a wide range of feeding modes was found among meiofaunal species. The diversity of the Broadstone community suggests that the impact of top predators tends to dissipate. A low proportion of top predators in the web was combined with a low mean number of prey items, other than detritus, in their guts (large predators, 1.08–1.26 prey/individual gut; small-sized tanypods, 2.15–2.32 prey/individual gut). Dietary similarity was highest in autumn and winter 1996, and observed feeding links of the most common predatory species showed low overlap in their diets. The web architecture of this stream is reticulate and complex, and the patterns observed in these seasonal webs differed from previous stream webs, resulting in low connectance, high linkage density, long food chains, and a high proportion of intermediate species and of intermediate–intermediate links. The food web derived from Broadstone Stream clearly demonstrates that the meiofauna increases web complexity and thus, taking into account their functional diversity, may be crucial to the understanding of food web properties and ecosystems processes in streams.},

  abstract = {The study of food webs has been a central theme within ecology for decades, and their structure and dynamics have been used to assess a range of key properties of communities (e.g. complexity–stability relationships) and ecosystems (e.g. fluxes of energy and nutrients). However, many food web parameters are sensitive to sampling effort, which is rarely considered, and further, most studies have used either species- or size-averaged data for both nodes and links, rather than individual-based data, which is the level of organisation at which trophic interactions occur. This practice of aggregating data hides a considerable amount of biologically meaningful variation and could, together with potential sampling effects, create methodological artefacts. New individual-based approaches could improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, food web structure and dynamics, particularly if they are derived from simple metabolic and foraging constraints. We explored the effect of species-averaging in four highly-resolved individual-based aquatic food webs (Broadstone Stream, the Afon Hirnant, Tadnoll Brook and the Celtic Sea) and found that it obscured structural regularities resulting from intraspecific size variation. The individual-based approach provided clearer insights into seasonal and ontogenetic shifts, highlighting the importance of the temporal component of size-structuring in ecological networks. An extension of the Allometric Diet Breadth Model predicted the structure of the empirical food webs almost twice as accurately as the equivalent species-based webs, with the best-fitting model predicting 83\% of the links correctly in the Broadstone Stream size-based web, and the few mismatches between the model and data were explained largely by sampling effects. Our results highlight the need for theoretical explanations to correspond closely with methods of data collection and aggregation, which is the exception rather than the rule at present. We suggest how this situation can be improved by including individual-level data and more explicit information on sampling effort when constructing food webs in future studies.},

  abstract = {Trophic studies are fundamental components of our understanding of biology and ecology, from observing individual organisms to modelling ecosystem function. When measuring fish gut contents, we rely on collecting samples that represent snapshots in time. Many limitations in extrapolating from these snapshots are well understood. However, there seems to be a widespread belief that when quantifying the composition of gut contents, more detail always provides more information. We highlight some fundamental problems with the apparently more quantitative approaches (i.e. ‘bulk’ methods measuring biomass or volume of each prey type) and suggest that frequency of occurrence (\%F) provides the most robust and interpretable measure of diet composition. The additional information provided by bulk methods contains unquantifiable and potentially significant error from a variety of sources. In our experience, the contents of most guts cannot be unambiguously separated into prey categories for quantification because of the presence of unidentifiable and inseparable partially digested material. Even where separation is possible, the composition of a gut at one point in time is affected by many unquantifiable factors unrelated to the actual composition of the diet. Consequently, bulk methods provide ambiguous interpretations from superficially quantitative models. Where research questions require more detail, these problems mean there is little alternative to time-consuming approaches like prey reconstruction. However, for the descriptions of dietary composition presented in many studies, \%F provides robust data that overcome many of the limitations of the more detailed approaches and provides considerable logistical and economic benefits.},

  abstract = {This study presents an analysis of the bias introduced by using simplified methods to calculate food intake of fish from stomach contents. Three sources of bias were considered: (1) the effect of estimating consumption based on a limited number of stomach samples, (2) the effect of using average contents derived from pooled stomach samples rather than individual stomachs, and (3) the effect of ignoring biological factors that affect the evacuation of prey. Estimating consumption from only two stomach samples yielded results close to the actual intake rate in a simulation study. In contrast to this, a serious positive bias was introduced by estimating food intake from the contents of pooled stomach samples. An expression is given that can be used to correct analytically for this bias. A new method, which takes into account the distribution and evacuation of individual prey types as well as the effect of other food in the stomach on evacuation, is suggested for estimating the intake of separate prey types. Simplifying the estimation by ignoring these factors biased estimates of consumption of individual prey types by up to 150\% in a data example.},

  abstract = {1 Stable isotope analysis (SIA) has the potential to become a widespread tool in mammalian ecology, because of its power in resolving the ecological and behavioural characteristics of animals. Although applications of the technique have enhanced our understanding of mammalian biology, it remains underused. Here we provide a review of previous applications to the study of extant mammals, drawing when appropriate on examples from the wider ecological literature, to identify the potential for future development of the approach. 2 Stable isotope analysis has been applied successfully to understanding the basic foraging decisions of mammals. However, SIA generates quantitative data on a continuous scale meaning that the approach can be particularly powerful in the characterization of community metrics, such as dimensions of resource partitioning within species assemblages or nutrient dynamics in food chains. Resolving spatial and temporal patterns of individual, intraspecific and interspecific resource use is of fundamental importance in animal ecology and evolutionary biology and SIA will emerge as a critical tool in these fields. 3 Geographical differences in naturally occurring stable isotopes have allowed ecologists to describe large-scale mammal migrations. Several isotopic gradients exist at smaller spatial scales, which can provide finer resolution of spatial ecology. 4 A combination of foraging and movement decisions is of prime importance in the study of ecotoxicology, since this discipline requires quantitative understanding of exposure risk.},

  abstract = {1 A new top predator, the dragonfly Cordulegaster boltonii Donovan, ‘invaded’ a stream with a well-described food web. 2 The pre-invasion web was species-poor but complex, with prevalent intraguild predation, cannibalism and omnivory. Such characteristics differ from expectations based upon the early food web literature, but are consistent with more recent empirical webs and theoretical developments. 3 Exhaustive sampling was necessary to describe web structure, with the gut contents of several hundred individuals being required to reach the asymptote of the total number of links for individual species. There was no single ‘standard’ sample size that was applicable for estimating the number of links: sampling ‘x’ guts gave a different fraction of the asymptotic value for different species. Smaller predators were more prone to underestimation of links than larger species higher in the web. 4 The number of feeding links, trophic status and the degree of omnivory increased progressively with predator body size, both within and among species. The diet of each predator species (or instar) was effectively a subset of the diet of the next largest predator. 5 The invader was extremely polyphagous and fed at all trophic levels. Mean chain length increased by half a link following the invasion. Web complexity, and omnivory in particular, also increased. Pre- and post-invasion webs displayed intervality and rigid circuitry. The resident predators were frequently eaten by the invader, but the only significant predators of C. boltonii were larger conspecifics. Although no species have yet been deleted, there has been a 21\% increase in links for a 6\% increase in species since the invasion, suggesting that the members of the web had become more tightly packed within niche space. Most prey species were eaten by every predator species (including C. boltonii), indicating the potential for strong apparent competition within the web.},

Using a large, moderately well-known web, we simulated ecologists’ efforts to detect member species and links between them at a variety of sampling intensities, and then we analyzed the effects of sampling intensity on a large number of properties of the resulting webs. Four striking points emerged. First, the properties of this single web vary markedly with the intensity of sampling: incompleteness of data can strongly bias estimates of food-web properties. Second, the original values are reached only after a high level of sampling, much higher than is typical for many studies. Third, the properties of most webs in the ECOWeB database lie at the poorly sampled end of the ranges. Fourth, the detection of trophic links systematically lags behind the detection and inclusion of species, which may render the accurate measurement of many web properties inherently problematic. These results suggest that both the incompleteness of the existing data and our focus on properties that are sensitive to that incompleteness may be giving us a misleading picture of the trophic structure of ecological communities.},

A high-resolution taxonomic description has been produced to characterise the different community components. We have also determined the trophic relationships among organisms by analysing their gut contents. From the network topology, we extracted several descriptors of structural complexity of the comunity in terms of number of nodes and links. We found a positive relationship between connectance and diversity (both biological and functional). Moreover, we developed and applied a quantitative approach to estimate the link strength, which showed that not all links constituting the network are equally important. In the present paper, we show that the strength of the food-web links vary over time, but there is a natural tendency to keep a small set of strong links throughout the year. However, the existence of two consecutive strong links is not common, meaning that trophic cascades are not promoted.},

  abstract = {Stable isotope ratios (typically of carbon and nitrogen) provide one representation of an organism's trophic niche and are widely used to examine aspects of food web structure. Yet stable isotopes have not been applied to quantitatively characterize community-wide aspects of trophic structure (i.e., at the level of an entire food web). We propose quantitative metrics that can be used to this end, drawing on similar approaches from ecomorphology research. For example, the convex hull area occupied by species in δ13C–δ15N niche space is a representation of the total extent of trophic diversity within a food web, whereas mean nearest neighbor distance among all species pairs is a measure of species packing within trophic niche space. To facilitate discussion of opportunities and limitations of the metrics, we provide empirical and conceptual examples drawn from Bahamian tidal creek food webs. These examples illustrate how this methodology can be used to quantify trophic diversity and trophic redundancy in food webs, as well as to link individual species to characteristics of the food web in which they are embedded. Building from extensive applications of stable isotope ratios by ecologists, the community-wide metrics may provide a new perspective on food web structure, function, and dynamics.},

For asking questions on how food webs are built and work, we need descriptions of food webs at different levels of resolution. DNA techniques provide opportunities for highly resolved webs. In this paper, we offer an exposé of how DNA-based techniques, and DNA barcodes in particular, have recently been used to construct food web structure in both terrestrial and aquatic systems. We highlight how such techniques can be applied to simultaneously improve the taxonomic resolution of the nodes of the web (i.e., the species), and the links between them (i.e., who eats whom). We end by proposing how DNA barcodes and DNA information may allow new approaches to the construction of larger interaction webs, and overcome some hurdles to achieving adequate sample size. Most importantly, we propose that the joint adoption and development of these techniques may serve to unite approaches to food web studies in aquatic and terrestrial systems—revealing the extent to which food webs in these environments are structured similarly to or differently from each other, and how they are linked by dispersal.},

We studied these effects by simulating primary species loss in 16 food webs from terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems and measuring robustness in terms of the secondary extinctions that followed. As observed in other networks, food webs are more robust to random removal of species than to selective removal of species with the most trophic links to other species. More surprisingly, robustness increases with food-web connectance but appears independent of species richness and omnivory. In particular, food webs experience `rivet-like' thresholds past which they display extreme sensitivity to removal of highly connected species. Higher connectance delays the onset of this threshold. Removing species with few trophic connections generally has little effect though there are several striking exceptions. These findings emphasize how the number of species removed affects ecosystems differently depending on the trophic functions of species removed.},

This Artificial Intelligence approach provides the ability to test the performance of any index for prioritizing species management in a network. While no single network theory index provides an appropriate guide to management for all food webs, a modified version of the Google PageRank algorithm reliably minimizes the chance and severity of negative outcomes.

Quantitative approaches are needed to identify unusually important or influential, ‘keystone’ species particularly for conservation purposes. Since the importance of some species may largely be the consequence of their rich interaction structure, one possible quantitative approach to identify the most influential species is to study their position in the network of interspecific interactions. In this paper, I discuss the role of network analysis (and centrality indices in particular) in this process and present a new and simple approach to characterizing the interaction structures of each species in a complex network. Understanding the linkage between structure and dynamics is a condition to test the results of topological studies, I briefly overview our current knowledge on this issue. The study of key nodes in networks has become an increasingly general interest in several disciplines: I will discuss some parallels. Finally, I will argue that conservation biology needs to devote more attention to identify and conserve keystone species and relatively less attention to rarity.},

  abstract = {Seasonal food webs were constructed for the whole invertebrate assemblage (meio- and macrofauna) inhabiting Broadstone Stream (southeast England). High and uniform taxonomic resolution was applied in a dietary analysis, by resolving the complete benthic community to species, including the meiofauna, protozoa, and algae. Meiofauna accounted for 70\% of all species in the summary web and for 73\% and 63\% of those in the summer/autumn and spring webs, respectively. The web structure changed between summer/autumn and winter/spring, due to differences in species composition. Many stream invertebrates fed on meiofauna and organic matter. Addition of meiofauna to the Broadstone web increased the percentage of intermediate species. Seasonal webs contained between 54 (spring 1997) and 86 (autumn 1996) interactive taxa and 229–378 trophic links. Marked differences in web complexity were found between the summer/autumn and winter/spring periods. Meiofauna accounted for most of the links in the web with a high proportion of intermediate–intermediate links in summer and autumn (0.421–0.440) and also of intermediate–basal links during winter and spring (0.509–0.628). In general, the summary web showed that intermediate species and basal resources were numerically dominant components in this stream. Web connectance rose slightly between summer (0.052) and winter (0.061) and increased further in spring (0.079), coinciding with a reduction in species number. A high fraction of detritivores was combined with omnivorous predators, many of which supplemented their diets with organic matter and, depending on season, with algae and invertebrate eggs. In addition, a wide range of feeding modes was found among meiofaunal species. The diversity of the Broadstone community suggests that the impact of top predators tends to dissipate. A low proportion of top predators in the web was combined with a low mean number of prey items, other than detritus, in their guts (large predators, 1.08–1.26 prey/individual gut; small-sized tanypods, 2.15–2.32 prey/individual gut). Dietary similarity was highest in autumn and winter 1996, and observed feeding links of the most common predatory species showed low overlap in their diets. The web architecture of this stream is reticulate and complex, and the patterns observed in these seasonal webs differed from previous stream webs, resulting in low connectance, high linkage density, long food chains, and a high proportion of intermediate species and of intermediate–intermediate links. The food web derived from Broadstone Stream clearly demonstrates that the meiofauna increases web complexity and thus, taking into account their functional diversity, may be crucial to the understanding of food web properties and ecosystems processes in streams.},

  abstract = {The study of food webs has been a central theme within ecology for decades, and their structure and dynamics have been used to assess a range of key properties of communities (e.g. complexity–stability relationships) and ecosystems (e.g. fluxes of energy and nutrients). However, many food web parameters are sensitive to sampling effort, which is rarely considered, and further, most studies have used either species- or size-averaged data for both nodes and links, rather than individual-based data, which is the level of organisation at which trophic interactions occur. This practice of aggregating data hides a considerable amount of biologically meaningful variation and could, together with potential sampling effects, create methodological artefacts. New individual-based approaches could improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, food web structure and dynamics, particularly if they are derived from simple metabolic and foraging constraints. We explored the effect of species-averaging in four highly-resolved individual-based aquatic food webs (Broadstone Stream, the Afon Hirnant, Tadnoll Brook and the Celtic Sea) and found that it obscured structural regularities resulting from intraspecific size variation. The individual-based approach provided clearer insights into seasonal and ontogenetic shifts, highlighting the importance of the temporal component of size-structuring in ecological networks. An extension of the Allometric Diet Breadth Model predicted the structure of the empirical food webs almost twice as accurately as the equivalent species-based webs, with the best-fitting model predicting 83\% of the links correctly in the Broadstone Stream size-based web, and the few mismatches between the model and data were explained largely by sampling effects. Our results highlight the need for theoretical explanations to correspond closely with methods of data collection and aggregation, which is the exception rather than the rule at present. We suggest how this situation can be improved by including individual-level data and more explicit information on sampling effort when constructing food webs in future studies.},

  abstract = {Analysis of predator–prey interactions is a core concept of animal ecology, explaining structure and dynamics of animal food webs. Measuring the functional response, i.e. the intake rate of a consumer as a function of prey density, is a powerful method to predict the strength of trophic links and assess motives of prey choice, particularly in arthropod communities. However, due to their reductionist set-up, functional responses, which are based on laboratory feeding experiments, may not display field conditions, possibly leading to skewed results. Here, we tested the validity of functional responses of centipede predators and their prey by comparing them with empirical gut content data from field-collected predators. Our predator–prey system included lithobiid and geophilomorph centipedes, abundant and widespread predators of forest soils and their soil-dwelling prey. First, we calculated the body size-dependent functional responses of centipedes using a published functional response model in which we included natural prey abundances and animal body masses. This allowed us to calculate relative proportions of specific prey taxa in the centipede diet. In a second step, we screened field-collected centipedes for DNA of eight abundant soil-living prey taxa and estimated their body size-dependent proportion of feeding events. We subsequently compared empirical data for each of the eight prey taxa, on proportional feeding events with functional response-derived data on prey proportions expected in the gut, showing that both approaches significantly correlate in five out of eight predator–prey links for lithobiid centipedes but only in one case for geophilomorph centipedes. Our findings suggest that purely allometric functional response models, which are based on predator–prey body size ratios are too simple to explain predator–prey interactions in a complex system such as soil. We therefore stress that specific prey traits, such as defence mechanisms, must be considered for accurate predictions.},

We explored the trophic role of Mysis diluviana in offshore Lake Ontario using samples collected in May, July, and September 2013 with a focus on seasonal and ontogenetic patterns in herbivory and zooplanktivory using two approaches. We hypothesized that Mysis diet in 2013 differs from the last investigation in 1995 in response to changes in pelagic prey over 1995 to 2013. Gut fluorescence indicated high grazing by adult and juvenile Mysis in May 2013. In July, smaller mysids were more herbivorous than larger individuals, a pattern that was less pronounced in September. Microscopic gut analysis showed copepods, including Limnocalanus, were common in diets of both size groups in May. In July, mainly cladocerans were consumed, including Cercopagis pengoi which represents a change from a past investigation that preceded Cercopagis invasion in the lake. Our results are consistent with earlier observations of a larger proportion of algae in mysid diets in spring, transitioning to relatively more zooplanktivory and use of cladocerans in the summer and fall. Higher chlorophyll content in small mysids in July than in September may be associated with the presence of a deep chlorophyll layer in July that had largely dissipated by September. Overall, Mysis in Lake Ontario continues to be a generalist omnivore, incorporating new prey items and exhibiting higher herbivory in spring.},

  abstract = {Investigations on the marine feeding of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) in the Northwest Atlantic are limited compared with the Northeast Atlantic. Climate-induced changes to food webs in Atlantic salmon feeding areas have been noted, alongside increased mortality despite a cessation of most marine fisheries. As forage efficiency may be hampering survival, it was important to address this knowledge gap. Atlantic salmon were sampled at three sites on the West Greenland coast (Sisimiut, Nuuk and Qaqortoq) between 2009 and 2011. Gut content and stable isotope analyses were combined to assess spatial and temporal differences in feeding. Capelin (Mallotus villosus) dominated the diet at Nuuk and Qaqortoq, whereas boreoatlantic armhook squid (Gonatus fabricii) was the dominant prey at Sisimiut. Hyperiid amphipods (Themisto spp.) and sand lance (Ammodytes spp.) were also important. Significant differences were found among sites for both gut contents and stable isotope analyses, with fewer differences evident temporally. Dietary differences were also evident across larger scales, with little overlap demonstrated with Northeast Atlantic diets and the emergence of boreoatlantic armhook squid as an important prey item over time. Atlantic salmon diets are frequently anchored on one or two prey items, on which they appear to specialize, but they will diversify to consume other available pelagic prey. Thus, Atlantic salmon are an opportunistic, generalist predator within the pelagic food web. The variability evident in diet suggests that the limited data available are insufficient to appropriately understand potential vulnerabilities that the species may have to ecosystem changes, and suggest further research is needed.},

Additionally, this study examined whether mesopelagic fishes utilized chemosynthetic energy from cold seeps. Specimens were collected (9–25 August 2007) over three deep ({$>$}1,000~m) cold seeps at discrete depths (surface to 1,503~m) over the diurnal cycle. GCA classified 31 species (five families) of mesopelagic fishes into five feeding guilds: piscivores, large crustacean consumers, copepod consumers, generalists and mixed zooplanktivores. However, these guilds were less clearly defined based on stable isotope mixing model (MixSIAR) results, suggesting diets may be more mixed over longer time periods (weeks–months) and across co-occurring species. Copepods were likely important for the majority of mesopelagic fishes, consistent with GCA (this study) and previous literature. MixSIAR results also identified non-crustacean prey items, including salps and pteropods, as potentially important prey items for mesopelagic fishes, including those fishes not analysed in GCA (Sternoptyx~spp. and Melamphaidae). Salps and other soft-bodied species are often missed in GCAs. Mesopelagic fishes had δ13C results consistent with particulate organic matter serving as the baseline organic carbon source, fueling up to three trophic levels. Fishes that undergo diel vertical migration were depleted in~15N relative to weak migrators, consistent with depth-specific isotope trends in sources and consumers, and assimilation of~15N-depleted organic matter in surface waters. Linear correlations between fish size and δ15N values suggested ontogenetic changes in fish diets for several species. While there was no direct measure of mesopelagic fishes assimilating chemosynthetic material, detection of infrequent consumption of this food resource may be hindered by the assimilation of isotopically enriched photosynthetic organic matter. By utilizing multiple dietary metrics (e.g. GCA, δ13C, δ15N, MixSIAR), this study better defined the trophic structure of mesopelagic fishes and allowed for insights on feeding, ultimately providing useful baseline information from which to track mesopelagic trophodynamics over time and space.},

The topology of these networks is a major determinant of ecosystems' dynamics and is ultimately responsible for their responses to human impacts. Several simple models have been proposed for the intricate food webs observed in nature. We show that the three main models proposed so far fail to fully replicate the empirical data, and we develop a likelihood-based approach for the direct comparison of alternative models based on the full structure of the network. Results drive a new model that is able to generate all the empirical data sets and to do so with the highest likelihood.

These generalizations are: (i) a species scaling law: the mean proportions of basal, intermediate and top species remain invariant at approximately 0.19, 0.53, and 0.29, respectively, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web; (ii) a link scaling law : the mean proportions of trophic links in the categories basal-intermediate, basal-top, intermediate–intermediate, and intermediate–top remain invariant at approximately 0.27, 0.08, 0.30 and 0.35, respectively, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web; and (iii) a link-species scaling law: the ratio of mean trophic links to species remains invariant at approximately 1.86, over the range of variation in the number of species in a web. This paper presents a model, the only successful one among several attempts, in which the first two of these empirical generalizations can be derived as a consequence of the third. The model assumes that species are ordered in a cascade or hierarchy such that a given species can prey on only those species below it and can be preyed on by only those species above it in the hierarchy.},

  abstract = {Network ecology holds great promise as an approach to modelling and predicting the effects of agricultural management on ecosystem service provision, as it bridges the gap between community and ecosystem ecology. Unfortunately, trophic interactions between most species in agricultural farmland are not well characterised empirically, and only partial food webs are available for a few systems. Large agricultural datasets of the nodes (i.e., species) in the webs are now available, and if these can be enriched with information on the links between them then the current shortage of network data can potentially be overcome. We demonstrate that a logic-based machine learning method can be used to automatically assign interactions between nodes, thereby generating plausible and testable food webs from ecological census data. Many of the learned trophic links were corroborated by the literature: in particular, links ascribed with high probability by machine learning corresponded with those having multiple references in the literature. In some cases, previously unobserved but high probability links were suggested and subsequently confirmed by other research groups. We evaluate these food webs using a new cross-validation method and present new results on automatic corroboration of a large, complex food web. The simulated frequencies of trophic links were also correlated with the total number of literature ‘hits’ for these links from the automatic corroboration. Finally, we also show that a network constructed by learning trophic links between functional groups is at least as accurate as the species-based trophic network.},

  abstract = {Food webs are important tools for understanding how complex natural communities are structured and how they respond to environmental change. However their full potential has yet to be realised because of the huge amount of resources required to construct them de novo. Consequently, the current catalogue of networks that are suitable for rigorous and comparative analyses and theoretical development still suffers from a lack of standardisation and replication. Here, we present a novel R function, WebBuilder, which automates the construction of food webs from taxonomic lists, and a dataset of trophic interactions. This function works by matching species against those within a dataset of trophic interactions, and ‘filling in’ missing trophic interactions based on these matches. We also present a dataset of over 20,000 freshwater trophic interactions, and use this and four well-characterised freshwater food webs to test the method. The WebBuilder function facilitates the generation of food webs of comparable quality to the most detailed published food webs, but at a fraction of the research effort or cost. Furthermore, it matched and often outperformed a selection of predictive models, which are currently among the best, in terms of capturing key properties of empirical food webs. The method is simple to use, systematic and, perhaps most importantly, reproducible, which will facilitate (re-) analysis and data sharing. Although developed and tested on a sample of freshwater food webs, this method could easily be extended to cover other types of ecological interactions (such as mutualistic interactions).},

  abstract = {Quantitative description of food webs provides fundamental information for the understanding of population, community, and ecosystem dynamics. Recently, stable isotope mixing models have been widely used to quantify dietary proportions of different food resources to a focal consumer. Here we propose a novel mixing model (IsoWeb) that estimates diet proportions of all consumers in a food web based on stable isotope information. IsoWeb requires a topological description of a food web, and stable isotope signatures of all consumers and resources in the web. A merit of IsoWeb is that it takes into account variation in trophic enrichment factors among different consumer-resource links. Sensitivity analysis using realistic hypothetical food webs suggests that IsoWeb is applicable to a wide variety of food webs differing in the number of species, connectance, sample size, and data variability. Sensitivity analysis based on real topological webs showed that IsoWeb can allow for a certain level of topological uncertainty in target food webs, including erroneously assuming false links, omission of existent links and species, and trophic aggregation into trophospecies. Moreover, using an illustrative application to a real food web, we demonstrated that IsoWeb can compare the plausibility of different candidate topologies for a focal web. These results suggest that IsoWeb provides a powerful tool to analyze food-web structure from stable isotope data. We provide R and BUGS codes to aid efficient applications of IsoWeb.},

In constructing this web, we integrate data from a variety of studies, many of which focussed on Anolis lizards and their vertebrate predators. In addition to determining the links between predators and prey, we estimate the frequencies of predation (the link strengths), and find an approximately bell—shaped distribution with a majority of links of intermediate frequencies. Some of the properties of this web contrast strongly with those of webs in the ECOWeB compilation. In particular, our analysis shows this web to possess an unusual richness of intermediate species (relative to top predators or basal species) and of links between those intermediate species. The number and lengths of chains are also unusually high, as is the degree of omnivory. Nor does this web match the predictions of the cascade model, which predicts even higher proportions of intermediate species and links between them, and even more numerous chains. It appears that these and other differences are not due simply to the large number of species involved here, but it is not yet clear whether they should be ascribed to the completeness with which some of the diets are known, to differences between the ways this and other webs were constructed, or to unique ecological conditions on the island of St. Martin.},

  abstract = {Here, we investigate patterns in the size structure of one marine and six freshwater food webs: that is, how the trophic structure of such ecological networks is governed by the body size of its interacting entities. The data for these food webs are interactions between individuals, including the taxonomic identity and body mass of the prey and the predator. Using these detailed data, we describe how patterns grouped into three sets of response variables: (i) trophic orderings; (ii) diet variation; and (iii) predator variation, scales with the body mass of predators or prey, using both a species- and a size-class-based approach. We also compare patterns of size structure derived from analysis of individual-based data with those patterns that result when data are ‘‘aggregated’’ into species (or size class-based) averages. This comparison shows that analysis based on species averaging can obscure interesting patterns in the size structure of ecological communities. Specifically, we found that the slope of prey body mass as a function of predator body mass was consistently underestimated and the slope of predator–prey body mass ratio (PPMR) as a function of predator body mass was overestimated, when species averages were used instead of the individuallevel data. In some cases, no relationship was found when species averages were used, but when individual-level data were used instead, clear and significant patterns were revealed. Further, when data were grouped into size classes, the slope of the prey body mass as a function of predator body mass was smaller and the slope of the PPMR relationship was greater compared to what was found using species-aggregated data. We also discuss potential sampling effects arising from size-class-based approaches, which are not always seen in taxonomical approaches. These results have potentially important implications for parameterisation of models of ecological communities and hence for predictions concerning the dynamics of ecological communities and their response to different kinds of disturbances.},

  abstract = {1 In recent years the use of species distribution models by ecologists and conservation managers has increased considerably, along with an awareness of the need to provide accuracy assessment for predictions of such models. The kappa statistic is the most widely used measure for the performance of models generating presence–absence predictions, but several studies have criticized it for being inherently dependent on prevalence, and argued that this dependency introduces statistical artefacts to estimates of predictive accuracy. This criticism has been supported recently by computer simulations showing that kappa responds to the prevalence of the modelled species in a unimodal fashion. 2 In this paper we provide a theoretical explanation for the observed dependence of kappa on prevalence, and introduce into ecology an alternative measure of accuracy, the true skill statistic (TSS), which corrects for this dependence while still keeping all the advantages of kappa. We also compare the responses of kappa and TSS to prevalence using empirical data, by modelling distribution patterns of 128 species of woody plant in Israel. 3 The theoretical analysis shows that kappa responds in a unimodal fashion to variation in prevalence and that the level of prevalence that maximizes kappa depends on the ratio between sensitivity (the proportion of correctly predicted presences) and specificity (the proportion of correctly predicted absences). In contrast, TSS is independent of prevalence. 4 When the two measures of accuracy were compared using empirical data, kappa showed a unimodal response to prevalence, in agreement with the theoretical analysis. TSS showed a decreasing linear response to prevalence, a result we interpret as reflecting true ecological phenomena rather than a statistical artefact. This interpretation is supported by the fact that a similar pattern was found for the area under the ROC curve, a measure known to be independent of prevalence. 5 Synthesis and applications. Our results provide theoretical and empirical evidence that kappa, one of the most widely used measures of model performance in ecology, has serious limitations that make it unsuitable for such applications. The alternative we suggest, TSS, compensates for the shortcomings of kappa while keeping all of its advantages. We therefore recommend the TSS as a simple and intuitive measure for the performance of species distribution models when predictions are expressed as presence–absence maps.},

Here, we examined 12 new stream food webs of higher taxonomic resolution and completeness than any previously published data set and combined them with other 10 published stream webs. 2. Compared with most previously published food webs, these stream communities (containing between 22 and 212 species) had more feeding links per species, a higher fraction of intermediate species (0·78-0·88) and lower fractions of top (0·04-0·09) and 'basal' species (0·07-0·15). 3. The exponent of the log link-log species relationship (S1· 3) differed significantly (ANCOVA: P {$<$} 0·001) from the link-species 'law' (S1) and the constant connectance hypothesis (S2). Based on these results, the link scaling law and the constant connectance hypothesis must be rejected for food webs in stream systems. 4. Connectance was markedly lower than previously reported and decreased with web size. We attribute this to the body-size disparity of organisms at the top and the bottom of the web, flow disturbance and to the high physical heterogeneity and complexity of the sedimentary habitat. All these may reduce the fraction of possible feeding links that are realized.},

  abstract = {Climate change is inducing deep modifications in local communities worldwide as a consequence of individualistic species range shifts. Understanding how complex interaction networks will be reorganized under climate change represents a major challenge in the fields of ecology and biogeography. However, forecasting the potential effects of climate change on local communities, and more particularly on food-web structure, requires the consideration of highly structuring processes, such as trophic interactions. A major breakthrough is therefore expected by combining predictive models integrating habitat selection processes, the physiological limits of marine species and their trophic interactions. In this study, we forecasted the potential impacts of climate change on the local food-web structure of the highly threatened Gulf of Gabes ecosystem located in the south of the Mediterranean Sea. We coupled the climatic envelope and habitat models to an allometric niche food web model, hence taking into account the different processes acting at regional (climate) and local scales (habitat selection and trophic interactions). Our projections under the A2 climate change scenario showed that future food webs would be composed of smaller species with fewer links, resulting in a decrease of connectance, generality, vulnerability and mean trophic level of communities and an increase of the average path length, which may have large consequences on ecosystem functioning. The unified framework presented here, by connecting food-web ecology, biogeography and seascape ecology, allows the exploration of spatial aspects of interspecific interactions under climate change and improves our current understanding of climate change impacts on local marine food webs.},

  abstract = {Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50\% of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species’ phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species’ interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species’ interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.},

In Petchey et al.

(b) Connectance emerges from the parameterisation, by measuring model fit using the true skill statistic, which takes into account prediction of both the presences and absences of links. 3) We fit the ADBM using approximate Bayesian computation to 16 observed food webs from a wide variety of ecosystems. Connectance was consistently overestimated in the new parameterisation method. In some of the food webs, considerable variation in estimated parameter distributions occurred, and resulted in considerable variation (i.e. uncertainty) in predicted food web structure. 4) We conclude that the observed food web data is likely missing some trophic links that do actually occur, and that the ADBM likely predicts some links that do not exist.

Most estimates of predator and prey sizes have been based on dietary studies and apply to small numbers of species in a relatively narrow size range. These estimates may or may not be representative of values for other groups of species and body sizes or for other locations. Marine predator and prey size data associated with published literature were identified and collated to produce a single data set. If predator or prey length of mass were not measured in the original study, the length or mass was calculated using length–mass relationships. The data set consists of 34 931 records from 27 locations covering a wide range of environmental conditions from the tropics to the poles and for 93 types of predator with sizes ranging from 0.1 mg to over 415 kg and 174 prey types with sizes from 75 pg to over 4.5 kg. Each record includes: predator and prey scientific names, common names, taxa, life stages and sizes (length and mass with conversion details), plus the type of feeding interaction, geographic location (with habitat description, latitude, longitude) and mean annual environmental data (sea surface temperature and primary productivity).},

Size-based community metrics are potentially useful indicators because of their theoretical foundation and practical utility. Temporal and spatial patterns in size-based community metrics for Celtic Sea fish are described and calculated using data from the English groundfish survey of the area (1987–2003). The results reveal that the size structure of the community has changed over time, and that a decrease in the relative abundance of larger fish was accompanied by an increase in smaller fish (4–25 g). Temporal analyses of the effects of fishing and climate variation suggest that fishing generally has had a stronger effect on size structure than changes in temperature. Therefore, size-based metrics respond clearly to the effects of fishing even in variable environments, reflecting the ubiquity of size-based processes in defining community structure and responses to mortality. Spatial analyses were inconclusive, probably owing to the limited area for which fishing effort, temperature, and survey data were all available.},

  abstract = {Feeding preferences of Celtic Sea fishes were investigated using a database of stomach content records, collected between 1977 and 1994. The diet of cod Gadus morhua, hake Merluccius merluccius, megrim Lepidorhombus whiffiagonis, whiting Merlangius merlangus and saithe Pollachius virens changed markedly as the animals grew larger, and although large predators generally chose larger bodied prey, the variability of prey sizes consumed also increased. Large predators continued to select small, low value, benthic prey (e.g. Callionymus spp. and Trisopterus spp.) which were easier to catch, rather than larger, more energy lucrative pelagic prey (e.g. mackerel Scomber scombrus), even though these pelagic prey-fishes were nearly always available and were often very abundant. Stock estimates of the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and U.K. groundfish survey catches were used as indices of prey abundance. Blue-whiting Micromesistius poutassou and other small pelagic fishes (Argentina spp. and clupeoids) were identified as being particularly important, and were consumed by some predators more often than would be expected given the abundance of these prey in the environment. There was no evidence for density-dependent feeding by predators on mackerel and only hake exhibited density-dependent feeding on horse-mackerel. Hake, cod and megrim consumed more blue-whiting when this prey was at higher abundance in the environment. In choosing what prey to consume, predators must balance costs and benefits, considering the quality of prey and the energy expended during search, capture and handling.},

  abstract = {Food webs, defined as {"}who eats whom{"} in nature, have become a central topic within  community ecology and thus they have been used to understand general ecological  patterns such as biodiversity and species interactions as well as material and nutrient  flows within ecosystems.  In South America the knowledge of the taxonomy and distribution of freshwater  invertebrates is incomplete and fragmented. Previous studies have focused on specific  taxonomic groups and some countries such as Brazil and Argentina. In contrast, there  have been many aquatic food webs published for UK freshwater systems with high  levels of taxonomic resolution.  This thesis aims to examine food web patterns in two geographically separated systems.  The effects of systematic taxonomic aggregation on food web properties were examined  and the relationship between consumer and prey body size revisited.  A total of 24 food webs were examined in Chilean and Welsh streams, where 6128  invertebrate guts were examined to establish feeding interactions. These Chilean and  Welsh food webs are amongst the largest, most complete and fully resolved. In both  systems there was a high proportion of basal species, combined with low proportions of  top and intermediate species. Significant differences were detected in most food web  properties, in comparison to previous studies, where basal species were aggregated to  coarser categories. No significant relationship between the body size of the consumers  and their prey was found in either Chilean or Welsh streams. These results differ  substantially from published data, and we attribute these differences to the greater  taxonomic resolution particularly on the basal resources.},

  abstract = {Estimation of invertebrate biomass is a critical step in addressing many ecological questions in aquatic environments. Length-dry mass regressions are the most widely used approach for estimating benthic invertebrate biomass because they are faster and more precise than other methods. A compilation and analysis of length-mass regressions using the power model, M (mass) = a L (length)b, are presented from 30 y of data collected by the authors, primarily from the southeastern USA, along with published regressions from the rest of North America. A total of 442 new and published regressions are presented, mostly for genus or species, based on total body length or other linear measurements. The regressions include 64 families of aquatic insects and 12 families of other invertebrate groups (mostly molluscs and crustaceans). Regressions were obtained for 134 insect genera (155 species) and 153 total invertebrate genera (184 species). Regressions are provided for both body length and head width for some taxa. In some cases, regressions are provided from multiple localities for single taxa. When using body length in the equations, there were no significant differences in the mean value of the exponent b among 8 insect orders or Amphipoda. The mean value of b for insects was 2.79, ranging from only 2.69 to 2.91 among orders. The mean value of b for Decapoda (3.63), however, was significantly higher than all insects orders and amphipods. Mean values of a were not significantly different among the 8 insect orders and Amphipoda, reflecting considerable variability within orders. Reasons for potential differences in b among taxa are explained with hypothetical examples showing how b responds to changes in linear dimensions and specific gravity. When using head width as the linear dimension in the power model, the mean value of b was higher (3.11) than for body length and more variable among orders (2.8-3.3). Values of b for Ephemeroptera (3.3) were significantly higher than those for Odonata, Megaloptera, and Diptera. For those equations in which ash-free dry mass was used, \% ash varied considerably among functional feeding groups (3.3-12.4\%). Percent ash varied from 4.0\% to 8.5\% among major insect orders, but was 18.9\% for snails (without shells). Family-level regressions also are presented so that they can be used when generic equations are unavailable or when organisms are only identified to the family level. It is our intention that these regressions be used by others in estimating mass from linear dimensions, but potential errors must be recognized.},

The linear function best describes dry weights in the order Isopoda of class Crustacea and dictyopteran, coleopteran larvae of class Insecta. The logarithmic function fits well for only one group namely Opiliones of class Arachnida.

The inter-relationships between dry weight, body length and head capsule width of individuals grouped according to the eight major orders of aquatic insects were also examined. Regression analysis indicated that the relationship between biomass and body size was best expressed by a power equation, Y =aXb, rather than by linear or exponential equations. Changes in body length versus head capsule width were best expressed by linear equations, with three distinct relationships being observed. Body length estimated biomass better than head capsule width. Populations often species of insects collected from two different rivers generally did not differ significantly in their dry weight to body length relationships.},

Regressions were calculated by fitting a power function to body-length parameters. For Gammarus roeseli, the head height, an easily measurable length parameter, was used. Differences between regressions of different taxa were confirmed by analyses of covariance. Equations for invertebrates grouped at a higher taxonomic level had lower coefficients of determination; therefore, the use of regression equations at the lowest possible taxonomic level is indicated. A comparison of regressions with those published for related taxa in streams revealed significant differences, supporting the opinion that equations should be applied carefully and their use restricted to waterbodies with similar abiotic conditions.},

  abstract = {1. The ciliate and metazoan meiofaunal assemblages of two contrasting lowland streams in south-east England were examined over the period of a year, using a high taxonomic resolution. Monthly samples were taken from an oligotrophic, acid stream (Lone Oak) and a circumneutral, nutrient-rich stream (Pant) between March 2003 and February 2004. 2. We assessed the relative importance of ciliates and rotifers within the small-sized benthic assemblage with respect to their abundance, biomass and species richness. In addition, we examined the influence of abiotic and biotic parameters and season on the assemblage composition at two levels of taxonomic resolution (species and groups). 3. Ciliates dominated the assemblages numerically, with maximum densities of over 900 000 and 6 000 000 ind. m−2 in Lone Oak and Pant respectively. Rotifers and nematodes dominated meiofaunal densities, although their contribution to total meiofaunal biomass (maxima of 71.9 mgC m−2 in Lone Oak and of 646.8 mgC m−2 in the Pant) was low and rotifer biomass equalled that of ciliates. 4. Although the two streams differed in terms of total abundance of ciliates and meiofauna and shared only 7\% of species, the relative proportion of groups was similar. Sediment grain size distribution (the percentile representing the 0.5–1 mm fraction) was correlated with assemblage structure at the species level, revealing the tight coupling between these small organisms and their physical environment. Seasonal changes in the relative abundance of groups followed similar patterns in both streams, and were correlated with the abundance of cyclopoid copepods and temperature. 5. Information on these highly abundant but often overlooked faunal groups is essential for estimates of overall abundance, biomass, species richness and productivity in the benthos, and as such has important implications for several areas of aquatic research, e.g. for those dealing with trophic dynamics.},

A promising approach to fill this gap is to predict interactions based on functional traits, but many questions remain about how well we can predict interactions for different taxa, ecosystems and amounts of input data. Here, we built a new traits-based model of trophic interactions for European vertebrates and found that even models calibrated with 0.1\% of the interactions (100 out of 71 k) estimated the full European vertebrate food web reasonably well. However, predators were easier to predict than prey, especially for some clades (e.g. fowl and storks) and local food web connectance was consistently overestimated. Our results demonstrate the ability to rapidly generate food webs when empirical data are lacking—an important step towards a more complete and spatially explicit description of food webs.},

  abstract = {Estimates of trophic levels (TLs) are used to calibrate, parameterize, and validate foodweb models and to calculate metrics and indicators of foodweb structure and human impacts. We develop a method to estimate TL from nitrogen stable isotope data (d15N) and apply it to 5535 individuals from 62 species of marine fish and squids sampled from the Celtic Sea, English Channel, Irish Sea, and North Sea. With this method, uncertainties in d15N at the base of the foodweb (from a marine isoscape generated with environmental data) and in trophic fractionation (from existing fixed and scaled fractionation models) are propagated through the analysis to quantify uncertainty in TL. Higher values of base and consumer d15N lead to greater uncertainty in TL estimates for individual consumers. Base and consumer d15N are higher in coastal regions with lower salinity, such as the Irish Sea and Channel coasts, so uncertainty in individual TL estimates is relatively high in these regions. Conversely, when base and consumer d15N are low, as in the high salinity waters of the northern North Sea, uncertainty is relatively low. Uncertainty intervals for species’ predicted TL at a reference mass (based on ≥10 individuals spanning a range of body sizes) are small compared with estimates for individual consumers, as are estimates of slope of the TL body mass relationship. For 50\% of region and species combinations showing trends in TL with body mass, there are eight times more positive relationships than negative ones. Our approach can be applied at large spatial scales. It generates estimates of uncertainty that support more rigorous and informed comparisons of the trophic ecology of size classes, species, and species-groups. A data file that includes estimates of TL and associated uncertainty for all sampled individuals accompanies this study.},

  abstract = {The ocean is a soup of its resident species' genetic material, cast off in the forms of metabolic waste, shed skin cells, or damaged tissue. Sampling this environmental DNA (eDNA) is a potentially powerful means of assessing whole biological communities, a significant advance over the manual methods of environmental sampling that have historically dominated marine ecology and related fields. Here, we estimate the vertebrate fauna in a 4.5-million-liter mesocosm aquarium tank at the Monterey Bay Aquarium of known species composition by sequencing the eDNA from its constituent seawater. We find that it is generally possible to detect mitochondrial DNA of bony fishes sufficient to identify organisms to taxonomic family- or genus-level using a 106 bp fragment of the 12S ribosomal gene. Within bony fishes, we observe a low false-negative detection rate, although we did not detect the cartilaginous fishes or sea turtles present with this fragment. We find that the rank abundance of recovered eDNA sequences correlates with the abundance of corresponding species' biomass in the mesocosm, but the data in hand do not allow us to develop a quantitative relationship between biomass and eDNA abundance. Finally, we find a low false-positive rate for detection of exogenous eDNA, and we were able to diagnose non-native species' tissue in the food used to maintain the mesocosm, underscoring the sensitivity of eDNA as a technique for community-level ecological surveys.

  abstract = {The analysis of food webs and their dynamics facilitates understanding of the mechanistic processes behind community ecology and ecosystem functions. Having accurate techniques for determining dietary ranges and components is critical for this endeavour. While visual analyses and early molecular approaches are highly labour intensive and often lack resolution, recent DNA-based approaches potentially provide more accurate methods for dietary studies. A suite of approaches have been used based on the identification of consumed species by characterization of DNA present in gut or faecal samples. In one approach, a standardized DNA region (DNA barcode) is PCR amplified, amplicons are sequenced and then compared to a reference database for identification. Initially, this involved sequencing clones from PCR products, and studies were limited in scale because of the costs and effort required. The recent development of next generation sequencing (NGS) has made this approach much more powerful, by allowing the direct characterization of dozens of samples with several thousand sequences per PCR product, and has the potential to reveal many consumed species simultaneously (DNA metabarcoding). Continual improvement of NGS technologies, on-going decreases in costs and current massive expansion of reference databases make this approach promising. Here we review the power and pitfalls of NGS diet methods. We present the critical factors to take into account when choosing or designing a suitable barcode. Then, we consider both technical and analytical aspects of NGS diet studies. Finally, we discuss the validation of data accuracy including the viability of producing quantitative data.},

  abstract = {1. A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks.},

  abstract = {Food webs are descriptions of who eats whom in an ecosystem. Although extremely complex and variable, their structure possesses basic regularities1,2,3,4,5,6. A fascinating question is to find a simple model capturing the underlying processes behind these repeatable patterns. Until now, two models have been devised for the description of trophic interactions within a natural community7,8. Both are essentially based on the concept of ecological niche, with the consumers organized along a single niche dimension; for example, prey size8,9. Unfortunately, they fail to describe adequately recent and high-quality data. Here, we propose a new model built on the hypothesis that any species' diet is the consequence of phylogenetic constraints and adaptation. Simple rules incorporating both concepts yield food webs whose structure is very close to real data. Consumers are organized in groups forming a nested hierarchy, which better reflects the complexity and multidimensionality of most natural systems.},

  abstract = {Climate effects on the structure and function of marine communities have received scant attention. The few existing approaches for predicting climate effects suggest that community responses might be predicted from the responses of component populations. These approaches require a very complex understanding of ecological interactions among populations. An alternate and informative parallel process is to ask whether it is possible to make predictions about community level responses to climate that are independent of knowledge about the identity and dynamics of component populations. We propose that it is possible to make such predictions, based on knowledge of the processes that determine the size–structure of communities. We suggest that theory that relates metabolic scaling, predator–prey interactions and energy transfer in size-based food webs, allows the size–structure and productivity of communities across a range of trophic levels to be predicted, provided that predictions of the effects of climate on primary production are available. One simple application of the community-focused predictions is to ask whether predictions of the size composition and abundance of populations for alternate climate scenarios are compatible with predictions for the size composition and relative abundance of communities. More sophisticated treatments could predict the effects of climate scenarios on multiple interacting populations and compare their combined size-abundance structure and production with that predicted for the community under the same climate scenario. The main weakness of the community approach is that the methods predict abundance and production by size-class rather than taxonomic group, and society would be particularly concerned if climate driven changes had a strong effect on the relative production of fishable and non-fishable species in the community. The main strength of the community approach is that it provides widely applicable ‘null’ models for assessing the biological effects of climate change and a baseline for model comparisons.},

  abstract = {Aim The aims of this study are to resolve terminological confusion around different types of species–area relationships (SARs) and their delimitation from species sampling relationships (SSRs), to provide a comprehensive overview of models and analytical methods for SARs, to evaluate these theoretically and empirically, and to suggest a more consistent approach for the treatment of species–area data. Location Curonian Spit in north-west Russia and archipelagos world-wide. Methods First, I review various typologies for SARs and SSRs as well as mathematical models, fitting procedures and goodness-of-fit measures applied to SARs. This results in a list of 23 function types, which are applicable both for untransformed (S) and for log-transformed (log S) species richness. Then, example data sets for nested plots in continuous vegetation (n = 14) and islands (n = 6) are fitted to a selection of 12 function types (linear, power, logarithmic, saturation, sigmoid) both for S and for log S. The suitability of these models is assessed with Akaike’s information criterion for S and log S, and with a newly proposed metric that addresses extrapolation capability. Results SARs, which provide species numbers for different areas and have no upper asymptote, must be distinguished from SSRs, which approach the species richness of one single area asymptotically. Among SARs, nested plots in continuous ecosystems, non-nested plots in continuous ecosystems, and isolates can be distinguished. For the SARs of the empirical data sets, the normal and quadratic power functions as well as two of the sigmoid functions (Lomolino, cumulative beta-P) generally performed well. The normal power function (fitted for S) was particularly suitable for predicting richness values over ten-fold increases in area. Linear, logarithmic, convex saturation and logistic functions generally were inappropriate. However, the two sigmoid models produced unstable results with arbitrary parameter estimates, and the quadratic power function resulted in decreasing richness values for large areas. Main conclusions Based on theoretical considerations and empirical results, I suggest that the power law should be used to describe and compare any type of SAR while at the same time testing whether the exponent z changes with spatial scale. In addition, one should be aware that power-law parameters are significantly influenced by methodology.},
